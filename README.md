🎬 Visionary: The Agentic Creative Studio
An Autonomous Multi-Agent Pipeline for Generative Media
Track: Freestyle Built With: Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), Gemini 2.5 Pro, Imagen 4.0, Veo 3.0

💡 The Pitch
The Problem
Generative AI tools are becoming increasingly powerful, but they operate in silos. Creating a cohesive visual story requires a user to be a "Prompt Engineer" for text-to-image models (like Imagen) and a "Physics Simulator" for video models (like Veo). The friction of switching contexts, managing prompt syntax, and maintaining visual consistency between static and motion assets turns creative exploration into a manual, error-prone chore.

The Solution
Visionary is an "Agency in a Box." It is a hierarchical multi-agent system that abstracts the complexity of generation. You don't prompt the model; you brief the Director, and the system spins up specialized agents to execute your vision.

The Director (Reasoning): Decomposes abstract briefs into production steps.

The Art Dept (Vision): Engineers high-fidelity prompts for Imagen 4.0.

The Motion Dept (Video): Orchestrates physics and camera movement for Veo 3.0.

⚙️ Technical Architecture
This project is built strictly using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), implementing a Sequential Hierarchical Workflow.

1. The Brain: Gemini 2.5 Pro
We utilize gemini-2.5-pro as the core reasoning engine for all agents. Its advanced instruction-following capabilities allow it to strictly adhere to the ADK's tool-calling protocols without hallucinating parameters.

2. The Workflow (Sequential Handoff)
The system relies on Contextual State Management to pass assets down the line:

User Input: "Cinematic glass city in clouds."

Director Agent: Analyzes intent and drafts a production plan.

Visual Agent: Receives the plan, generates a Real 4K Image via Imagen 4.0, and returns a unique Asset ID.

Motion Agent: Receives the Asset ID, retrieves the specific file path, and submits it to Veo 3.0 for animation.

🛠️ Implementation Details (The "Pick 3")
This project satisfies the Capstone requirements by implementing the following core agentic concepts:

Feature 1: Multi-Agent System (Supervisor-Worker)
We moved beyond simple prompt chaining by creating distinct adk.Agent personas. The Director has no tools; its only job is supervision. The Visual and Motion agents are specialized workers. This separation of concerns ensures that the prompt engineering logic for images does not bleed into the motion parameters for video.

Feature 2: Custom Tools & Live API Integration
The agents interact with the world via custom Python tools wrapping the google-genai SDK:

generate_image_real(prompt): Connects to imagen-4.0-fast-generate-001. It handles the API handshake, byte-stream conversion, and saves a physical .png to the local filesystem.

generate_video_manifest(image_id, motion): Connects to veo-3.0-fast-generate-001. Due to the asynchronous nature of video rendering, this tool handles job submission, polling, and signed-URL retrieval.

Feature 3: Sessions & Memory
We use the ADK's InMemoryRunner to maintain the thread of conversation. This allows the Motion Agent to "remember" the specific image generated by the Visual Agent earlier in the session, creating a cohesive product rather than disconnected assets.

🚀 The Hybrid Deployment Strategy
Running state-of-the-art video models in a constrained Notebook environment presents specific challenges regarding Cloud IAM (Identity Access Management) for Google Cloud Storage buckets.

To ensure a robust submission, Visionary employs a Hybrid Architecture:

Reality Engine (Image): The system generates Real images using Imagen 4.0, proving the agent's ability to control production-grade APIs.

Architectural Engine (Video): For the video step, the agent generates a "Render Manifest" artifact (or attempts a signed download). This validates the agent's logic, tool-use, and parameter extraction capabilities, ensuring the architectural flow is complete even if Cloud Storage permissions block the final MP4 download in the notebook runner.
